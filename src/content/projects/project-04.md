## Project Overview

MetaVerse Academy transforms traditional education through immersive VR/AR experiences. Students can explore historical events, conduct virtual science experiments, or practice surgical procedures in photorealistic environments. The platform adapts to each student's learning style using AI-driven personalization.

## Technical Challenges

The biggest challenge was achieving low-latency performance while maintaining high-fidelity graphics across different devices. We implemented a dynamic LOD system with edge-computed rendering, allowing seamless experiences even on mobile VR headsets.

## Testimonial
