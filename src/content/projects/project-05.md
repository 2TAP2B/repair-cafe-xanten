## Project Overview

DeFi Pulse is a groundbreaking financial platform that bridges traditional finance with Web3 capabilities. The system enables instant cross-chain transactions, automated yield farming, and decentralized identity management while maintaining bank-grade security standards.

## Technical Challenges

The primary challenge was ensuring atomic transactions across multiple chains while preventing sandwich attacks. We developed a novel consensus mechanism using zero-knowledge proofs that reduces transaction costs by 80% while maintaining security.
